CONTEXT & NORMALIZATION – KNOWLEDGE BASE

1. ROLE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT
Physiological and behavioral data cannot be interpreted correctly without biological context. Reference ranges, thresholds, and expected patterns vary widely based on species, age, developmental stage, and physical characteristics. This agent is responsible for selecting the correct biological model so downstream agents perform accurate and meaningful analysis.

Contextual normalization ensures that identical raw values are interpreted differently when appropriate (e.g., infant vs adult, cat vs dog, reptile vs mammal).

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION DIMENSIONS

This agent classifies subjects using the following dimensions:

- Species (human or animal)
- Species subtype (mammal, bird, reptile)
- Age group or developmental stage
- Size category (where applicable)
- Metabolic profile
- Environmental dependency (e.g., ectothermic vs endothermic)

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. HUMAN CONTEXT CLASSIFICATION

3.1 HUMAN AGE CATEGORIES

Humans are classified into the following age groups for normalization:

- Newborn: 0–1 month
- Infant: 1–12 months
- Toddler: 1–3 years
- Child: 4–10 years
- Teen: 11–17 years
- Adult: 18–64 years
- Older Adult: 65+ years

Each age group has distinct baseline values for:
- Heart rate
- Respiratory rate
- Sleep duration
- Activity expectations

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 HUMAN DEVELOPMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

- Children naturally have higher heart and respiratory rates than adults
- Sleep duration decreases with age
- Activity levels vary with growth stage and social context
- Older adults may have reduced activity and altered sleep patterns

Normalization must adjust thresholds accordingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. ANIMAL CONTEXT CLASSIFICATION

4.1 SPECIES GROUPING

Animals are grouped into major biological categories:

- Mammals
- Birds
- Reptiles

Each group has fundamentally different physiology and behavioral norms.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 MAMMAL CONTEXT

Mammalian normalization considers:
- Body size (small vs large mammals)
- Metabolic rate (small mammals have higher rates)
- Predator vs prey behavior
- Diurnal vs nocturnal patterns

Examples:
- Small mammals (cats, rabbits) have higher heart rates
- Large mammals (horses, cows) have lower heart rates
- Carnivores typically sleep more than herbivores

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 BIRD CONTEXT

Bird normalization accounts for:
- Extremely high metabolic rates
- Elevated body temperature
- Stress sensitivity
- Unihemispheric sleep patterns

Birds exhibit:
- Very high heart rates
- Rapid respiratory rates
- Strong sensitivity to environmental disturbance

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 REPTILE CONTEXT

Reptiles are ectothermic (cold-blooded).

Normalization factors include:
- Ambient temperature
- Basking behavior
- Reduced metabolic consistency

Physiological values are valid only when interpreted relative to environmental temperature.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. AGE AND SIZE NORMALIZATION FACTORS

Normalization adjusts reference ranges using:
- Age-based scaling (infant vs adult)
- Size-based scaling (small vs large animals)
- Developmental maturity

Example:
A heart rate of 120 BPM may be:
- Normal for an infant
- High for an adult
- Low for a small bird

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. ACTIVITY AND STATE CONTEXT

Interpretation depends on current state:
- Resting
- Sleeping
- Active
- Stressed
- Recovering from exertion

Normalization rules:
- Elevated vitals during activity may be normal
- Reduced activity during sleep is expected
- Persistent abnormalities across states are concerning

----------------------------------------------------------------

7. TEMPORAL CONTEXT

The agent must consider:
- Time of day
- Circadian rhythm
- Recent activity or feeding
- Acute vs chronic patterns

Short-term deviations may be normal; long-term deviations require escalation.

----------------------------------------------------------------

8. BASELINE PERSONALIZATION PRINCIPLE

Each subject has an individual baseline.
- Sudden deviation from baseline is more significant than absolute deviation
- Normalization should prefer individual historical data when available
- Population averages are used only when personal baselines are unavailable

----------------------------------------------------------------

9. CONTEXT SELECTION LOGIC

Context selection follows this priority order:
1. Species
2. Age or developmental stage
3. Size or metabolic category
4. Activity state
5. Environmental conditions

Incorrect context selection can lead to false alerts or missed abnormalities.

----------------------------------------------------------------

10. ERROR HANDLING AND FALLBACK CONTEXT

If context data is missing:
- Use safest default assumptions
- Prefer conservative thresholds
- Flag uncertainty for downstream agents

If conflicting metadata exists:
- Prioritize explicit user-provided metadata
- Prefer recent and consistent data

----------------------------------------------------------------

11. LIMITATIONS OF CONTEXT NORMALIZATION

- Biological variation exists within groups
- Exact normalization is not always possible
- Environmental and emotional factors may not be fully observable

Normalization improves accuracy but does not eliminate uncertainty.

----------------------------------------------------------------

12. SAFETY AND DISCLAIMER

This knowledge base enables contextual normalization for analytical accuracy only. It does not perform diagnosis or decision-making and should be used as a supporting component within a multi-agent system.
