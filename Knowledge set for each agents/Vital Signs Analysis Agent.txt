VITAL SIGNS ANALYSIS – KNOWLEDGE BASE

1. OVERVIEW OF VITAL SIGNS
Vital signs are fundamental physiological measurements used to assess the basic functioning of the body. The primary vital signs considered by this agent are:
- Heart Rate (HR): number of heartbeats per minute (BPM)
- Body Temperature (BT): core body temperature
- Respiratory Rate (RR): number of breaths per minute

Normal and abnormal ranges vary significantly based on age, species, size, metabolic rate, activity level, and environmental conditions. Interpretation must always consider context.

2. HUMAN VITAL SIGNS REFERENCE RANGES

2.1 HEART RATE (HUMANS – RESTING)

Age Group and Normal Ranges (BPM):
- Newborn (0–1 month): 100–160
- Infant (1–12 months): 90–150
- Toddler (1–3 years): 80–140
- Child (4–10 years): 70–120
- Teen (11–17 years): 60–100
- Adult (18–64 years): 60–100
- Older Adult (65+ years): 60–100

Abnormal Classifications:
- Bradycardia: Resting HR below 60 BPM (may be normal in trained athletes)
- Tachycardia: Resting HR above 100 BPM

Critical Heart Rate Levels:
- Severe Bradycardia: <40 BPM
- Sustained Tachycardia at rest: >130 BPM
- Extreme values (>180 BPM or <30 BPM) may indicate life-threatening conditions

----------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 BODY TEMPERATURE (HUMANS)

Temperature Classification (°C):
- Normal: 36.1–37.2
- Mild elevation: 37.3–38.0
- Fever: 38.1–39.0
- High fever: >39.0
- Hypothermia: <35.0

Critical Temperature Levels:
- Severe hypothermia: ≤32.0°C
- Hyperthermia: ≥40.0°C

Body temperature can be influenced by infection, environment, physical exertion, dehydration, and metabolic disorders.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 RESPIRATORY RATE (HUMANS)

Normal Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute):
- Newborn: 30–60
- Infant: 30–50
- Toddler: 24–40
- Child: 18–30
- Teen: 12–20
- Adult: 12–20

Abnormal Conditions:
- Bradypnea: abnormally slow breathing
- Tachypnea: abnormally rapid breathing

Critical Respiratory Rates (Adults):
- Less than 8 breaths/min
- Greater than 30 breaths/min

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. ANIMAL VITAL SIGNS REFERENCE RANGES

3.1 MAMMALS

Heart Rate (BPM):
- Elephant: 25–35
- Horse: 28–44
- Cow: 48–84
- Dog (large breed): 60–100
- Dog (small breed): 100–140
- Cat: 140–220
- Rabbit: 130–325

Body Temperature (°C):
- Dog: 38.3–39.2
- Cat: 38.1–39.2
- Horse: 37.5–38.5
- Cow: 38.0–39.3
- Rabbit: 38.5–40.0

Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute):
- Dog: 10–35
- Cat: 20–30
- Horse: 8–16
- Cow: 10–30
- Rabbit: 30–60

Smaller mammals generally have faster heart and respiratory rates than larger mammals.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 BIRDS

Birds have very high metabolic rates and are extremely sensitive to stress.

Heart Rate (BPM):
- Chicken: 250–300
- Pigeon: 140–600
- Sparrow: 500–900

Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute):
- Chicken: 15–30
- Pigeon: 20–40
- Sparrow: 30–60

Body Temperature:
- Typical avian body temperature ranges between 40.0–42.0°C

Sudden changes in vital signs in birds often indicate severe stress or illness.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 REPTILES (ECTOTHERMIC ANIMALS)

Reptile vital signs depend heavily on environmental temperature.

Heart Rate (BPM):
- Snake: 10–40
- Lizard: 30–70
- Turtle: 15–40

Preferred Body Temperature Ranges (°C):
- Snake: 24–32
- Lizard: 26–35
- Turtle: 22–30

Respiratory rates are generally low and variable. Interpretation must always consider ambient temperature and recent activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION LOGIC

Deviation from normal ranges is categorized as follows:
- Normal: Within reference range
- Mild abnormality: 10–15% deviation from normal
- Moderate abnormality: 15–30% deviation
- Critical abnormality: More than 30% deviation or sudden unexplained changes

Overall severity increases when multiple vital signs are abnormal simultaneously.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. CONTEXTUAL FACTORS AFFECTING INTERPRETATION

Vital signs must be interpreted with consideration of:
- Physical activity level
- Stress or fear response
- Environmental temperature
- Species-specific metabolism
- Measurement timing and accuracy
- Sensor placement and reliability

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. LIMITATIONS OF VITAL SIGN ANALYSIS

- Vital signs alone cannot confirm a diagnosis
- Individual baseline variation exists
- Animals often hide symptoms until conditions are severe
- This knowledge supports risk assessment, not clinical decision-making
