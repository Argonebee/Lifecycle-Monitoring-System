ACTIVITY & MOBILITY ASSESSMENT – KNOWLEDGE BASE

1. OVERVIEW OF ACTIVITY AND MOBILITY
Activity and mobility reflect the functional, neurological, and behavioral state of an organism. Normal movement patterns vary based on age, species, health status, and environmental context. Significant reductions or abnormalities in activity often indicate lethargy, fatigue, pain, stress, illness, or distress.

Activity assessment includes:
- Total daily movement
- Frequency of movement
- Intensity of activity
- Voluntary vs involuntary motion
- Changes from individual baseline behavior

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. HUMAN ACTIVITY NORMS BY AGE

2.1 EXPECTED DAILY ACTIVITY LEVELS (HUMANS)

Children and Adolescents:
- Typical activity includes frequent movement, play, and exploration
- Recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity: ≥60 minutes/day
- Prolonged inactivity or withdrawal from play may indicate fatigue or distress

Adults:
- Recommended physical activity:
  - ≥150 minutes/week of moderate activity OR
  - ≥75 minutes/week of vigorous activity
- Regular daily movement is expected even in sedentary lifestyles

Older Adults:
- Lower intensity but consistent movement expected
- Emphasis on mobility, balance, and routine activity

----------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 HUMAN ACTIVITY STATES

Common activity states include:
- Resting (minimal movement)
- Light activity (walking, stretching)
- Moderate activity (brisk walking, chores)
- Vigorous activity (running, sports)

Persistent absence of expected activity for age and context is considered abnormal.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 HUMAN ABNORMAL ACTIVITY INDICATORS

- Prolonged inactivity during waking hours
- Sudden reduction in daily movement
- Avoidance of routine activities
- Difficulty initiating movement
- Unsteady or slowed gait

Such patterns may indicate fatigue, pain, neurological issues, or psychological stress.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. ANIMAL ACTIVITY AND MOBILITY NORMS

Animal activity is strongly influenced by species behavior, predator-prey dynamics, and circadian rhythms.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 MAMMALS

Expected Activity Patterns:
- Dog: Regular bursts of activity, walking, play; prolonged inactivity during daytime may indicate illness or depression
- Cat: Cyclic bursts of activity with extended rest periods; complete withdrawal or hiding is abnormal
- Horse: Frequent standing, walking, grazing; reluctance to move is concerning
- Cow: Regular movement for feeding and social interaction; reduced mobility may indicate pain or illness
- Rabbit: High alertness with short active periods; immobility or reluctance to move indicates stress or fear

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 BIRDS

Bird activity includes:
- Perching
- Flight
- Vocalization
- Grooming (preening)

Abnormal indicators:
- Reduced flight attempts
- Excessive stillness
- Sitting fluffed for long periods
- Loss of balance or coordination

Birds often mask illness; reduced activity is a serious warning sign.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 REPTILES

Reptile activity is dependent on environmental temperature.

Expected Patterns:
- Periods of basking followed by movement
- Reduced activity during cooler temperatures

Abnormal indicators:
- Persistent immobility in optimal temperatures
- Failure to respond to stimuli
- Inability to move normally

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. ACTIVITY SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

Activity deviations are classified as:

- Normal Activity: Movement patterns align with species and age norms
- Mild Reduction: Slight decrease in activity without functional impairment
- Moderate Reduction: Noticeable lethargy or reduced engagement
- Severe Reduction: Near immobility, collapse, or inability to move

Sudden or progressive declines are more concerning than gradual changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. DISTRESS AND LETHARGY INDICATORS

Common indicators include:
- Reduced spontaneous movement
- Decreased interaction with environment
- Reluctance to stand, walk, or play
- Prolonged resting outside normal sleep periods
- Abnormal posture or movement patterns

In animals, lethargy often precedes visible symptoms of illness.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. CONTEXTUAL MODIFIERS

Activity interpretation must consider:
- Age and developmental stage
- Recent physical exertion
- Injury or recovery state
- Environmental temperature and terrain
- Stress, fear, or social factors
- Time of day and circadian rhythm

----------------------------------------------------------------

7. BASELINE COMPARISON PRINCIPLE

Each individual has a unique activity baseline.
- Sudden deviation from baseline is more significant than absolute values
- Short-term inactivity may be normal; persistent patterns are concerning

----------------------------------------------------------------

8. LIMITATIONS OF ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT

- Low activity does not always indicate illness
- Temporary inactivity may result from rest or environmental conditions
- Sensor or reporting inaccuracies can affect interpretation

----------------------------------------------------------------

9. SAFETY AND DISCLAIMER

This knowledge base supports activity and mobility assessment for risk identification only. It does not diagnose medical or veterinary conditions and should not replace professional evaluation when abnormal inactivity or distress persists.
